# Azure Reservation Management?

## What is it?

The possibility to [reserve resources in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/reservations/save-compute-costs-reservations) has the potential to provide significant savings for most organizations with workloads in Azure. Managing reservations on a central level can realize these savings while offloading this responsibility from product teams and giving them increased flexibility.

`
Note: Past experiences indicate that organizations can expect to save 20-40% of an organization's total VM compute cost by using a centralized management approach for reservations.
`

The **Azure Reservation Management** offering provides a framework that provides an initial set of processes, practices and tools for how to establish centralized management of reservations in an organization.
